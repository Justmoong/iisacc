  "summary": "I frequently contemplate that contemporary individuals find themselves situated within an environment uniquely predisposed to existential melancholy. This observation is unlikely to be mine alone. The demographic-intensive society that emerged through radical transformation following the Industrial Revolution imposes a pervasive exhaustion upon individual existence. Even when one desires solitary respite, such withdrawal proves impossible, and distancing oneself from the myriad inexorable forces that encircle us has became increasingly elusive. Admittedly, we do find solace in interpersonal relationships and experience mutual affection. This constitutes an undeniable good. Within the teeming masses of modernity, we can more readily discover friendship and love, enabling us to embrace greater challenges. Nevertheless, no individual can sustain perpetually passionate living. The repose essential to some remains unavailable to all. We have grown estranged from rest, solitude, tranquility, and liberty."
