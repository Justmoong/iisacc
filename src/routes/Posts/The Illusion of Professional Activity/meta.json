  "summary": "Let us suppose there is a person who has cultivated a refined habit of reading op-eds from prestigious media outlets. This person, once exposed to platforms like YouTube or Netflix—which can dull human intelligence—experiences a disquieting sensation and resolves to assert cognitive control over what they see and hear, striving instead to exercise superior forms of cognition and intellectual ambition. Consequently, the person deliberately devotes several minutes to hours each day to reading specialized books or academic journals in their field on a regular basis."
