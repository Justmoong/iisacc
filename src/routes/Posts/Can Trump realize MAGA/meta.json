  "summary": "It is undeniable that Donald Trump intuitively pinpointed the critical structural flaws of the American industrial system. The collapse of the manufacturing base, the disconnection between the financial sector and the real economy, the decline of the middle class, the strategic vulnerability of global supply chains, and the resulting weakening of America’s national competitiveness—all of these issues had accumulated long before his presidency. However, it was Trump who, by explicitly raising them as political agendas, brought them to the forefront of public discourse. This is no minor achievement and can be regarded as a pivotal turning point in modern American history."
