  "title": "The paradox of technological progress",
  "date": "2025-06-12",
  "summary": "Humanity has, over the years, advanced not the tangible, but the intangible — digital realms, political ideologies, finance, and services — while neglecting the progress of real, material economies such as medicine, manufacturing, and urban development. JavaScript evolves by the day, yet we still ride automobiles invented over two centuries ago, deluding ourselves into believing civilization has progressed. In truth, these changes hold little real substance in this world. Nothing fundamental has truly changed."
